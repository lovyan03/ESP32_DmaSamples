# ESP32_DmaSamples
  
This is an image drawing sample using DMA transfer of SPI master driver.  
  
## Description  
The ESP32 SPI master driver has a DMA (Direct Memory Access) transfer function that allows the SPI master driver to directly send and receive data in the memory without a CPU.
With this function, the CPU can do other work during SPI data transfer.
